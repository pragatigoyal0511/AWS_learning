How Compute Evolved in AWS?

| Stage                      | What You Manage                         | Example    | What Problem It Solved             | What Problem Still Remained                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **EC2 (Virtual Machines)** | You manage **servers**                  | Amazon EC2 | No need for physical hardware      | But you still patch OS, scale, monitor, etc. |
| **Containers (ECS/EKS)**   | You manage **apps + container runtime** | ECS / EKS  | Easier app packaging, faster start | Still need to manage cluster, scaling, cost  |
| **Serverless**             | You manage **only code**                | AWS Lambda | No infrastructure to manage        | Limited control over runtime, timeouts       |



So, Serverless = next level of simplification.

Why Serverless Came?
Even with containers, you still had to:

Run EC2s or clusters under ECS/EKS.
Pay for them even when apps are idle.
Handle scaling up/down.
Monitor CPU/memory and tune sizes.

Developers said:
‚ÄúI just want to run my function or app logic, not manage servers or containers!‚Äù

AWS listened ‚Äî and introduced Serverless Compute, starting with AWS Lambda.


What ‚ÄúServerless‚Äù Actually Means?
‚ÄúServerless‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean no servers exist üòÑ
It means:

You don‚Äôt manage or even see the servers. AWS does everything for you.
No provisioning EC2s.
No container clusters.
No scaling setup.
You only upload your code.

AWS:
Decides where to run it.
Automatically scales it up/down.
Charges only when it runs.


->Example to Understand:

->Before (with EC2)
You rent a computer 24x7.
Even if you get 1 visitor, you still pay for the whole day.
You install OS, Python, security patches, etc.

üß© With Containers

You rent 1 computer and run multiple apps.
Better utilization, but still always on.
You still manage the container cluster.

üß© With Serverless (Lambda)
You don‚Äôt rent a computer at all.
You just say: ‚ÄúRun this function when user clicks a button.‚Äù
AWS runs it for a few milliseconds, then stops.
You pay only for those milliseconds.

‚úÖ No idle cost
‚úÖ No patching
‚úÖ Auto scale to millions instantly


5Ô∏è‚É£ Example: AWS Lambda (Serverless Compute)

You upload your code (in Python, Node.js, Java, etc.).
You define a trigger (API Gateway, S3 upload, DynamoDB event, etc.).
AWS Lambda runs your code only when triggered.

You pay per request + compute time (milliseconds).

Example:

When a user uploads an image to S3:
S3 triggers a Lambda.
Lambda resizes the image.
Lambda stops.

You pay for only those few seconds.


When Not to Use Serverless?
It‚Äôs not perfect ‚Äî avoid it when:

You need long-running tasks (since Lambda has max 15-min runtime).
You need custom OS/network setups.
You need super low-latency responses (for high-frequency trading, etc.).
You need full control over the environment.

Then you go back to ECS/EKS/EC2.



why is user responsible for os security updates in ec2 when it comes installed?
How EC2 works

Remember:
EC2 is Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
AWS provides virtual hardware, networking, and the option to choose an operating system.
But once the OS is installed, you are effectively running a full computer ‚Äî like a regular laptop or server.

That means:
AWS doesn‚Äôt know what software you install.
AWS doesn‚Äôt automatically maintain your OS or apps.

So the responsibility for keeping the OS secure falls on you.
