Shared Security model - matlab, AWS and customer noth are responsible for security

HOW?

AWS ki responsibility hai poore aws set up ko secure karna..to secure the physical hardware, regions, AZs, etc.. and also to secure  the
software like services offered by as..like compute,storage,databases,virtualization layer etc.. Any upgrades, patching required would be taken 
care by AWS itself.

So, basically security of the cloud


Whereas

Customer is responsible of security in the cloud. Security of your workloads. Apne data ko khud secure karo.
When you use some service, security configurations jo use karne hain khud lagao and secure karo. Firewall vagarh
DAta ko secure using encrytion and all.
Who can access what, all these security needs to be taken care by customer itself.
Like if we select the region for aws, which is not compliant to the company for security purpose then its our responsibility and not aws ki.

Every service offered by aws might have different security required. Accordingly, jo hum use karein, uske according security lagani hogi.
