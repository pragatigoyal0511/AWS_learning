EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud: Amazon EC2 is a service from AWS that lets you create virtual computers (servers) on the internet — whenever you want, for as long as you want.


Imagine you want to run a website or an app.

Normally, you’d have to:
Buy a computer (server)
Install Linux or Windows
Set up software
Keep it running 24/7

With Amazon EC2, you just:
Go to the AWS console
Click “Launch EC2 Instance”
Choose how powerful you want the computer to be (RAM, CPU, etc.)
And boom — in less than a minute, you have a running virtual computer online.

You can connect to it just like your own computer and run anything — website, app, database, etc.

Elastic : because its capacity can be increased or decreased. We only pay as we use, just like paying for electricity.
CLoud: This computer availble on cloud, online
Compute : This is computational server. Cloud-based computing power


Real-world comparison:

It’s like renting a hotel room (computer) instead of buying a house (server).
You can rent it for 1 hour or 1 year.
Choose the size you want.
Leave anytime.
You don’t worry about maintenance — Amazon handles that.
