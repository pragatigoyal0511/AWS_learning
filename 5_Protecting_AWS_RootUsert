When we first access the AWS account, we have the identity username and password. 
With this root user we have all the access related to AWS account.
If somehow, this credentials gets compromised, then boom anything can happen..

Therefore, to secure its good to have Multi factor Authentication..usmein...ab 2 cheez ho gai
something you know - that is user name passowrd/pin
something you have - MFA device jispe koi pin hogi ya kuch

MFA also done using something you are - like finger print biometric and aall


AWS mein account hone ke baad, to access AWS api using cli or api we must have access keys
access key id
secret access key

This is like having basic auth cred to access any backend api..ye aur secure kar deti hai, taaki only valid users can access this..

If you are not using, then better to delete the access keys from console managment section.

And also, if you want to use, use from another user with certain level of permissions, so that root user ko toh sab access hota hai, vo kam use
karo, aapko everyday use mein root user ki cheezein toh nahin chahyea hoti hain..
